title: "Overcoming the Climate Policy Dilemma: The Role of Debt and Redistribution under Intergenerational Borrowing Constraints"
collection: work_in_progress
permalink: 
excerpt: 'We investigate the effect of (intergenerational) borrowing constraints on climate policy in a simple political economy model where households differ in income. Binding borrowing constraints reduce implicit discount rates. We analyze how intra- and intergenerational transfers can increase support for climate policy. (With Matthias Kalkuhl and Maximilian Kellner)'
