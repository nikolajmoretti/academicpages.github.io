Hi! My name is Nikolaj Moretti and I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Research Department 5 of the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en), formerly the [MCC Berlin](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html), and the [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/wiso/) where I am affiliated with the [Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA)](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/cepa/welcome-to-cepa).  

I work on topics at the intersection of climate policy and public debt. My methodological toolkit encompasses formal and numerical modelling as well as econometrics. Ongoing projects are concerned with the consequences of borrowing constraints in political economy models as well as (optimal) fiscal rules.

Apart from my research interests, I am fond of (Italian) cuisine and music in general. I sing and play the guitar in a band. My current project is to improve my improvisation skills on the guitar and get on stage at a Blues jam session.

Stemming from my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I have a fascination for category theory and its applications. Even though I currently do not find the time to cultivate it, I hope to return to it at some future point in time.
