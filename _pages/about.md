Hi! My name is Nikolaj Moretti and I am a Ph.D candidate in economics at the [Mercator Research Instiute on Global Commons and Climate Change Berlin](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/index.html) and the University of Potsdam.  

I work on topics at the intersection of climate policy and public debt. Methodwise, I currently focus on formal and numerical modelling. However, I do have a background and strong interest in econometric methods, too. Current projects focus on consequences of the presence of borrowing constraints in a political economy model, risk premia on international capital markets on international carbon emission mitigation and climate adaptation in emerging economies, as well as fiscal rules.  

Stemming from my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I have a fascination for category theory and its applications. Even though I currently do not find the time to cultivate it, I hope to return to it at some future point in time.
