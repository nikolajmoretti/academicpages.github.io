excerpt: ' We elaborate a fiscal rule that conditions the admissible deficit for a government on the observed reduction in carbon emissions based on a welfare economic framework. We call this adaptation of the classical “golden rule of public finance” to the climate context “green-golden rule”. The conceptualization of climate-investment as reduction in carbon emissions has a key advantage: Carbon emissions are measurable in t/CO2 and homogeneous with returns given by the Social Cost of Carbon. This makes it possible to overcome the major criticisms to the golden rule, namely the difficulty to assess the returns on public investment and the vagueness of the definition of invesmtent and the connected “creative accounting critique”. We quantify a quantity version and a price version of the rule for the case of Germany. '

**Abstract**: Fiscal rules that limit government deficits address the problem of excessive public debt, but can have negative consequences for the provision of durable public goods. In a model with climate policy, we analyze the relationship between such deficit rules and emission reductions induced by climate policy. While deficit rules reduce excessive government debt, this comes at the expense of emission reductions. In contrast, a green--golden rule, inspired by the golden rule of fiscal policy, can induce both the efficient deficit and the efficient emission reductions. The rule links the admissible deficit to observed emissions or carbon prices and to the social cost of carbon. We illustrate admissible debt levels for a quantity- and a price version of the rule.
A cumulative decrease in emissions of 280 Mt CO2 between 2020 and 2030 would lead to an admissible cumulative deficit of around 160 Bn. Euro. Increasing the carbon price to 200 Euro/tCO2 in 2024 would grant additional fiscal space amounting to 0.3% of GDP per year to a government that could be spent unconditionally.
In comparison to the general golden rule, the green--golden version has decisive advantages when it comes to its practical implementation.
